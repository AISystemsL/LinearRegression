# LinearRegression
Example of Linear regression, using gradient descent algorithm. 
Just basic example with only two weights, 1-dimension input and 1-dimension output.
With Loss function using Tikhonov regularization. 
Graph plotting (with sympy or matplotlib) of the Error(w) and Loss(w) over time (learning steps/epochs).
